<h3>GCSE</h3>
<p>I begun programming in 2011, teaching myself at home. Shortly after this
  Computing GCSE began. We were taught .NET but I decided to complete my GCSE
  project in Java as that was what I had learnt at home. I achieved an A in GCSE Computing.</p>
<h3>Games Development</h3>
<p>During this time I began learning to use Unity game engine and C#, I have created
  a number of small games since. Including a couple that were released to the
  Android market.<br>
  They have since been removed due to Google Play policies updating, but the APK's and market pages can still be viewed
  <a href="https://apkpure.com/sacred-shield/com.NyteGames.SacredShield" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://apkpure.com/star-survival/com.NyteGames.IcyRoad">here</a>.
<h3>Web Development</h3>
<p>Towards the end of my GCSE years I began showing an interest in web development. This eventually turned into a project called Strato.io.
  The site was never properly released, it was hugely ambitous, but I did get it to a workable state and it's an idea I am interested
  in going back to and re-doing. I wrote a couple of blog posts about the site and the time that can be seen <a href="http://nyte9.tumblr.com/post/121422024183/introducing-stratoio">here</a> and <a href="http://nyte9.tumblr.com/post/122958429968/strato-just-got-a-whole-lot-bigger">here</a>.
  The site was built in HTML, CSS and Javascript/JQuery on the front-end, and had a PHP back-end which sat on a Digital Ocean server.

<h3>Dota 2 Custom Games</h3>
<p>My biggest success (user-wise) to date was a custom game I built for Dota 2. As soon as the tools were released to developers
  I jumped in and tried to figure things out. The programming here was done in Lua. This was the first time I was learning to program
  with a tool that did not have a huge community and only limited documentation online. To me this was a very valuable learning experience.
  The custom game is not played anymore however the days following its released it amassed thousands of players. Today it sits at 75,900 downloads, with over
  22,000 ratings averaging 4/5 stars. The page on the steam workshop for the game can be seen <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=307904772">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>A-Level</h3>
<p>During my A-Levels I furthered my Java and Unity3D skills. My A-Level project was a 3D clone of one of my favourite games at the time <a href="http://supercratebox.com/">Super Crate Box</a>.
  The game came together nicely. I achieved a C in A-Level Computing. <br>
  I also completed an Extended Project Qualification at school. This was a social media image sharing application where users could upload photos
and vote on other peoples photos similarly to swiping on tinder. The votes would reflect the popularity of the image, more popular images
would be shown to more people. The project was never officially released, I achieved a C in my EPQ.</p>
<h3>Work Experience</h3>
<p>During the summer of 2015 I completed a weeks work experience with a devops and web dev team at Travis Perkins in Northampton.<br>
  This was my first introduction to a software development work environment and Agile development.
  </p>
<h3>University</h3>
<p>
At University my programming experience has widened greatly. Modules have required me to learn more Java, C/C++, Python, and more PHP.
We've used a vast array of tools and learnt how to program in a professional environment with techniques such as those used in Agile.<br>
To name a few uni projects:<br>
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">A battle bot script</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">A tennis league maintaining system</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">A site showing info. about different cities utilizing various API's</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">An online taxi booking system, using a google maps API </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>More WebDev</h3>
<p>
In my spare time at uni I also created a couple of small sites. One of which would take a direct link to an audio file and create a page
where said file can be streamed, and the submitter could view statistics about who was streaming their song.<br>
Another project was a lottery for the cryptocurrency Nano. Users bought tickets by sending crypto to an address on the site,
tickets simply contained the address and how many tickets the amount they sent was worth - no sign up system. One address would be randomly
selected at the end and the majority of money the site had been sent would be given to that winner. <br>
I never publically announced the site as I was afraid of possible legal repercussions and insecurities in the site.

<h3>University Dissertation</h3>
<p>My ongoing dissertation is another image sharing application built in React Native, with a PHP and MySQL back-end.
The code for this project can be explored <a href="https://github.com/im-OJ/vote" target="_blank">here</a>, keep in mind that it is very much unfinished.<br>
A poster showing progress of this project was made towards the end of January and can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hYOXus2DWvZLxgcj1iiWMU2FZQIqL0-oy7zsfkjL_ZU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<h3>This Site</h3>
<p>
  I've made this site from scratch the past couple of days using HTML, Bootrstrap and Javascript. The git repo is <a href="https://github.com/im-OJ/Portfolio" target="_blank">here</a>.
