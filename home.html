<p>
  I am a 21 year old student currently in my final year studying Computer Science at UWE.<br>
  I'm currently looking for work in Bristol for after I graduate this summer.<br>
  My ideal job would be developing software at a small company or startup.<br>
</p>
<h3>Programming & Computer Science</h3>
<p>
I begun programming at 12 years old and haven't looked back since. At school I studied Computing GCSE and A-Level while also partaking in a number of personal projects at home.<br>
Since then I was sure Computer Science would be the degree for me. <br>
I have thrived at UWE, being able to study computer science left me a lot happier than I was at school. I could finally focus on something I believed was good at. <br>
I hope to carry this same energy into my first industry position.

<h3>Personal Life & Music</h3>
<p> As well as programming in my spare time I also produce music, I have been doing this for 4 years now. This has been the perfect hobby for
  me, it allows me to express myself creatively and the technical aspects appeal to the problem solver in me.<br>
  Some of my music may be available to listen to <a href='https://soundcloud.com/lost_and'>here</a>.<br>
  I am currently working on an EP that should be availble on all main streaming services later this year.
</p>
<p>
Outside of music and computer science I love spending time with friends and family. My family lives near Stratford-upon-Avon which is where I grew up and went to school. At home
I have two sisters and a dog, this is where I live outside of Uni (though I hope to find a place in Bristol should I find a good job).<br>
I also (try to) go to the gym 5 times a week, I find this really helps me feel alive throuhgout the day and gives me a nice sense of achievement.<br>
